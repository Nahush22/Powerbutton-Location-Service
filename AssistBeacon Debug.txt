1. Background location worked perfectly in Redmi 4
2. Background location service didn't work a while after app was minimised....restarted after opening app
3. Tried using foreground location tracking but same problem
4. Added background_location permission to manifest & location value to foregroundservicetype attribute of service in manifest
5. Removing battery saver control of app fixed issue....now location tracking triggered whenever power button clicked
6. Enabling Auto Start permission in app info didn't fix the issue


PROBLEM APPARENTLY DUE TO DOZE BEHAVIOR ADDED IN MARSHMALLOW THAT RESTRICTS NETWORK ACCESS FOR BG SERVICES(Even Foreground)

Potential Fixes:

1.Use WorkManager to perform location tracking(https://github.com/android/location-samples/issues/220)
2.Use JobScheduler
3.Use AlarmManager
4.Requesting user to disable battery saver for current app
